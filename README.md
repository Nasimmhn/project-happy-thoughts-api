# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project is to use my new skills with Express and Mongodb to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.
I have previously created the frontend part in this repo => https://github.com/Nasimmhn/project-happy-thoughts.
So after this RESTful API was deployed on Heroku I used it the previous fronend project.

## Endpoints
- https://happy-thoughts-api-by-nasim.herokuapp.com/thoughts (GET/POST)
- https://happy-thoughts-api-by-nasim.herokuapp.com/:thoughtId/like (POST)

## Learning objectives ðŸ§ 

* To build an API which includes handling of user input (POST).
* To include error handling and return reasonable validation errors.
* To build an API which works well with an existing frontend.

## Technologies used ðŸ’»
