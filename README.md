# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project is to use my new skills with Express and Mongodb to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.
I already have created the frontend part of this project, repo here => https://github.com/Nasimmhn/project-happy-thoughts. After my RESTFUL api was deployed on Heroku, then I just fetched it into my Happy-Thought project.
